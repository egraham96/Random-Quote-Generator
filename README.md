# Random Quote Project

## Time allotment
This project should take under two hours. We obviously have no way to time you, but would prefer if you gave yourself a stopping time two hours after you start and just send over whatever you have.

If you're not done in that window, that's okay. Feel free to explain where you were, what got you stuck, and where your next steps would be after your time ran out.

Send your files to jneely@forio.com when you're finished.


## Project requirements
For this project, we want you to use an API to generate random quotes. While the quote is being retreived, we want to show a diagonal screen wipe with a new, random color each time. See the example here:

This is just an example and it does not have to look exactly like that. In fact, the quote section is pretty ugly and could be improved if you have time and an eye for design. If not, that's okay too.

You can find the random quote API endpoint here:

Note that this API intentionally kind of sucks. It's pretty quick, but it does have an issue where it fails about 10% of the time. We can't fix the API, so we'll need to figure out a decent way to handle that.

The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are purely boilerplate to get you started. Feel free to change as much or as little of it as you would like.


## Bonus
We also have another example where the user doesn't even have to click- the page automatically generates a new quote after a set amount of time (can be any length). If you're done with the above, feel free to tackle this part. It's not required and should be done only if you have time.
